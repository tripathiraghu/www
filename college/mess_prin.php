  <p align="justify"><b>&quot;When we educate a woman, we educate a generation&quot;.<br><small>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year, millions of students  are denied an education at a time when it has the power to transform their  lives and the world around them.<br>
    Shri Pragya College, Bijainagar (Ajmer) has always attempted to pursue the path  of excellence in education for the last 5 decades and has directed to  initiatives and its path of reforms towards providing quality education. We  provide holistic education by molding the total personality of a student, it  has through its curricular initiatives, helped to strengthen the bond of  national unity and foster in young minds love for the fellow one, to be a good  and able member of the society.<br>
  <b><strong><em>&quot;Challenges and Opportunites are two sides of the same coin&quot;.</em></strong></b><br>
    Modern education, curriculum development and teaching methodologies have to  keep pace with the demand of the economic environment and ever evolving  technologies. For us every student is important and keeping primacy the student&rsquo;s  experience, voices, their interested and active participation we must follow  the axiom that every student is talented.<br>
  <b><strong><em>&quot;Empowerment of girls for their all rounds development through  education is our cherished motto&quot;</em></strong></b><br>
    Today education means much more than merely acquiring knowledge. It is acquisition  of knowledge and skills, building character and improving employability of our  young talent, the future leadership. Women are leaders everywhere you took I am  proud of being the part of such a wonderful institution dedicated to the causes  of better India. Through education and their real empowerment. I am grateful to  inform you that we are planning Shri Pragya College to be a&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Deemed University&quot;</strong>&nbsp;upcoming  year. Come on, let's give our best and make this institution a modern temple of  learning through our diligence, devotion and dedication.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  congratulate all the staff and students for bringing laurels to the institute  in the past and hope they will continue their sincere efforts jointly in  achieving the excellence in every field, particularly in academics and sports.  I wish everyone my best wishes in the endeavor.<br>
  <em>WISHING YOU ALL THE BEST!!!</em> </p>
